Recompiling... reason: file './counter.sv' is newer than expected.

		Caching library 'worklib' ....... Done
	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
	Top level design units:
		counterclass
xmelab: *W,DSEMEL: This SystemVerilog design will be simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.
	Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
	Building instance specific data structures.
	Loading native compiled code:     .................... Done
	Design hierarchy summary:
		                    Instances  Unique
		Modules:                    1       1
		Registers:                 30      35
		Initial blocks:             3       3
		SV Class declarations:      3       3
		SV Class specializations:   3       3
	Writing initial simulation snapshot: worklib.counterclass:sv
Loading snapshot worklib.counterclass:sv .................... Done
